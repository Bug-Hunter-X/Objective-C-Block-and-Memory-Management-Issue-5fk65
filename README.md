# Objective-C Block and Memory Management Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Objective-C related to memory management and the use of blocks within object enumeration.  The problem arises when modifying objects within an enumeration block, potentially causing unexpected object deallocation or retain cycles.

The `bug.m` file contains the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.m` file provides a solution using weak references or careful handling of object lifecycles to prevent the issue.

## Problem Description

The core issue is the implicit retention of `self` by the block combined with potential modifications to objects that might change their retention counts. This can lead to an object being prematurely released or to retain cycles.  This example focuses on an `NSMutableArray`'s `enumerateObjectsUsingBlock` method. However, similar issues can occur with other enumeration techniques and data structures.
